# Small Talk

Jane [1]: Oh hello, I almost didn't see you there. How are you?
John [2]: I'm well, thanks for asking. How about you?
Jane [3]: Oh, you know, same as I ever was. What are you up to?
John [4]: Just out to pick up a few things before the stores close for the day. On that note, I should run.
Jane [5]: Ah, I won't keep you then.
